# hands-on-Gibbs-correction
This code presents a step-by-step calculation of the thermal correction to Gibbs free energy using molecular vibrational frequencies, following the statistical mechanics formalism as implemented in the Gaussian16 software package.
There has been some confusion among beginners regarding whether the famous Gaussian16 implicitly incorporates the zero-point energy (ZPE) contribution into the reported thermal correction to Gibbs free energy. In this code, I have explicitly extracted the vibrational frequencies and other thermochemical parameters from the Gaussian output and recalculated the thermal correction to Gibbs free
energy using the same statistical mechanical framework as employed by Gaussian. Our results confirm that Gaussian16 does implicitly include the ZPE contribution in its thermal correction to Gibbs free energy. Therefore, when computing the final Gibbs free energy by adding the thermal correction to the electronic energy, there is no need to add ZPE separately; otherwise, the Gibbs free energy will be overestimated by exactly the amount of the zero-point contribution.
